# Simple Hack Assember built using Rust

This was just a simple experiment to build a a simple Hack assembler based on the Hack assembly language as part of the Nand2Tetris module. It allows me to revisit lower level languages, as well as practice a bit on the Rust language also, which I'd planned on doing for a while. Hoping to tighten up the code a bit, before moving onto potentially larger Rust projects overall.
